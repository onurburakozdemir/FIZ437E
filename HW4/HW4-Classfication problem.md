# Animal Image Classification
In this homework we will test different machine learning models on animal classification problem (cow, sheep, horse). We'll start by implementing a convolutional neural network (CNN) and then move on to multilayer perceptron (MLP) architecture. Finally we will compare the two methods for image classification
