# Animal Image Classification
In this homework we will test different machine learning models on animal classification problem (cow, sheep, horse). We'll start by implementing a convolutional neural network (CNN) and then move on to multilayer perceptron (MLP) architecture. Finally we will compare the two methods for image classification

## Methods

* 1 - [Multilayer Perceptron](https://github.com/onurburakozdemir/FIZ437E/blob/main/HW4/HW4_MLP.ipynb) [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/onurburakozdemir/FIZ437E/blob/main/HW4/HW4_MLP.ipynb)


* 2 - [Convolutional Neural Network](https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-image-classification/blob/master/2_lenet.ipynb) [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1nT0pNA9n1BhAZ35gOk5jr700uQX9yuDs?usp=sharing)

## About The Data
<img src="https://wallpaperaccess.com/full/553645.jpg" width="300" height="200" />
We used cute pictures of:

- 1866 pictures of cows
- 2623 pictures of horses
- 1820 pictures of sheeps

## Results and Final Plots
The resuts are found to be %57 accuracy with MLP and %x accuracy with CNN.
